The Thread class is a Impllimentation Class Of Runnable Interface

Atributes Of Thread
--------------------
Thread class Defines 3 Attributes
1. Thread ID :- the Thread id is a Unique identification Of the Each Thread Created In The JVM
-the ID of The Thread Is Intitialized By the JVM Uniqely
-we cant Assign OR change the Value of ID 

2.Thread Name :- Each Thread Created In The JVM Should Have A NAme
- The Programmer Can Provide His own Name for The Thread If there is No Default name

3.Thread Prioprity :- it defines The Priority Of the Thread, Based On the Thread Priority The JVM 
                      Allocats Thread Resources and Schedule The Exicution, 
                      The Priority Is The Intiger Number from 1 to 10 Where 1 is a Lowest Prority And 10 is a Highest Priority,Defult priority is 5.
 -Thread have Overloaded Constructor
 
 Methods Of Thread
 -----------------
 1.public int getId(); 
 2.public String getName(); 
 3.public int getPriority(); 
 4.public void setName(); 
 5.public void setPriority(); 
 6.public void start();  --> on Calling This Method The Thread Exicution Begains In the JVM
 7.public void stop();  --> on Calling This Method The Thread Exicution stoped In the JVM,which is in Exicution this Method Is Depricated
 8.public void run(); --> Yhe Run Method used To Define The Task of THe Thread. In Thread Class The Run Method has a Empty Body
 9.public void sleep(long time) throws IntruptedException --> the Method Causes THe Current Running Thread To Sleep For THe Specified Time ,
                                                              the Time Valiue IS Always mesuserd In MiliSeconds
 10.public void currentThread();
 -->This Method Returns The Ref to The Current Thread running In The Context
 
 
 How To Create A Thread
 ======================
 simple create a Object OF Thread Class 
   i.e 
 Thread t=new Thread();
